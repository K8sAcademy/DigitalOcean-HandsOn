Let's create a new Droplet.

## Droplet creation

In the Control Panel menu, click on Droplets.

Click on the Marketplace tab and select Docker.

Choose a plan and pricing tier.  The cheapest plan will work for this lab.

Select the region and the authentication method.

You can change the default name and finally, create the Droplet.

## Cleanup

Don't delete the Droplet yet.  We'll use it in the next lab.
