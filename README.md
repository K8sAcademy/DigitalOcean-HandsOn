This technical course covers the core Docker and Kubernetes concepts and guides you to build, deploy and monitor containers on DigitalOcean App Plaform, Droplets and DigitalOcean Kubernetes Service (DOKS). Developers, DevOps, SREs and I.T. Pros will learn how to use containers locally and on DigitalOcean. You’ll experience several demos and hands-on exercises throughout the course as you learn how to build, deploy and monitor containers on DigitalOcean. No coding experience is required for the hands-on activities but you’ll use the terminal, command prompt and VS Code extensively.

You’ll learn about microservices and their use cases. You’ll then learn about containers and Kubenernetes. You’ll learn how to deploy and manage microservices applications packaged in containers locally. This will provide you the essential foundation that you’ll need before heading to the cloud.

Next, it’s all about Kubenernetes on DigitalOcean. You’ll apply what you learned previously so that you can deploy, manage and maintain your applications on DigitalOcean Kubernetes Service like a ninja!

Finally, you’ll learn about 3rd party tools like Helm, Prometheus and Grafana. How to use dashboards like Lens and K9s. How to configure an Ingress controller and learn the benefits of using a Service Mesh and how to use one.
